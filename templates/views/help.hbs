    <p>Hello! Welcome to my very first NodeJs application "Winker|Weather App" hope you like it. Following are some useful instructions that may help you while using this app:</p>
    <p>You can search for weather with the help of places' name e.g Boston,US; Karachi,Pk etc. And you can also search by using zip code e.g 19147. The more specific you enter the location, the more accurate search results you'll get.
        Thankyou!</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>
